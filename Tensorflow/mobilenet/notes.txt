[problem]:
NotFoundError (see above for traceback): Restoring from checkpoint failed. 
This is most likely due to a Variable name or other graph key that is missing from the checkpoint. 
Please ensure that you have not altered the graph expected based on the checkpoint. Original error:
Key MobilenetV1/Logits/Conv2d_1c_1x1/act_quant/MobilenetV1/Logits/Conv2d_1c_1x1/act_quant/max/biased not found in checkpoint

[solved]:
maybe because the program reload from old training directory.
just rm -rf train_dir where saves the checkpoint
